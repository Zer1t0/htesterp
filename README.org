#+title: HTesTerP

HTTP(S) endpoints tester. 

It receives hosts (domains or ips) as input and check for HTTP endpoints,
similar to [[https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe][httprobe]]. 


As output, htesterp can provide for valid endpoints:
- url
- status code
- title

* Setup

In order to install the use the tool there are several options.

From crates.io (cargo):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo install htesterp
htesterp -h
#+END_SRC

From source:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/Zer1t0/htesterp.git
cd ./htesterp
cargo build --release
./target/release/htesterp -h
#+END_SRC

* Usage

To show the options, use the well-known ~-h/--help~:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
htesterp -h
#+END_SRC

You can feed htesterp with a host (domain or ip), a file of hosts or stdin:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
htesterp www.contoso.com
htesterp /tmp/contoso_domains
echo "contoso.com" | htesterp
#+END_SRC

You can get the title with ~-t~ and status with ~-s~:
#+begin_example shell
$ htesterp www.reddit.com -ts
http://www.reddit.com:80 301 
https://www.reddit.com:443 200 reddit: the front page of the internet
#+end_example

By default, it checks the http port 80, and https port 443. To specify other
ports you can use ~-p~. If you prepend ~http~ or ~https~ to port number, then
only the selected protocol will be check, in other case both will be scanned.

For example, the following command checks the ports 8000 and 8080 with http and
ports 8000 and 8443 with https:
#+begin_example shell
htesterp -p http:8080,https:8443,8000
#+end_example


You can use it with other tools that retrieve domains, such as
[[https://github.com/OWASP/Amass][amass]] or [[https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder][subfinder]]. The following command retrieves title and status and checks
the 8080 http and https ports:
#+begin_example
subfinder -d reddit.com | htesterp -ts -p 8080
#+end_example
